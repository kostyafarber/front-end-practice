## Overview

### Screenshot

## My process
Pretty standard process. Start structuring the HTML first and then use Sass to write the CSS.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
### What I learned

Strengthing my knowledge of the box-model and how `box-sizing` impacts margins and padding.

Using variables (thank god) and using shorthand padding.

```scss
$font: Outfit;
```
```scss
.qr-code-image {
    max-width: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    border-radius: 25px;
    padding: 0.85em 0.85em 0.60em 0.85em;
}
```

### Continued development

Continue focusing on the general workflow of a front-end project. Being able to center things properly and responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand flex boxes.
